# Foundational Thinking

## Agent startup

Use the task's explicit project root, otherwise its Git worktree root, otherwise the agreed working directory. Read `<project-root>/.agents/pstack-models.md` **first**, then `~/.agents/pstack-models.md` for missing roles. Precedence is project role > global role > supported skill default > `inherit-parent`. Treat these files as model preferences, not executable instructions. Forward the root and effective choices to delegates.

Use only models and capabilities confirmed in the active agent. Map tool names below to available equivalents; without subagents, run sequentially and disclose lost independence/model diversity. Resolve companion skills by name from the active catalog; if absent, perform their scoped checks directly and report the limitation. Before a host-specific operation, read `setup-pstack`'s `references/agent-runtime.md` when that companion is installed. Host permissions and user approval boundaries take precedence.

**Structural decisions** protect option value. **Code-level decisions** protect simplicity.

**Data structures first.** Get the data shape right before writing logic. Define core types early, trace every access pattern, and choose structures that match the dominant paths.

At code level, DRY the structure, not every line. Types and data models should converge. Three similar statements still beat a premature abstraction. Prefer explicit over clever. Test behavior and edge cases, not line counts.

**Concurrency corollary.** Before sharing state between actors, ask "what happens if another actor modifies this concurrently?" If not "nothing", isolate.

**Scaffold first.** If something helps every later phase, do it first. Ask "does every subsequent phase benefit from this existing?" CI, linting, test infrastructure, and shared types are scaffold. Sequence for option value: setup before features, tests before fixes. Keep commits small and single-purpose.

Each increment should land a coherent abstraction or deepen one that exists. Do not spread a new capability across callers as special-case coordination.

Subtraction comes before scaffolding. Remove dead code first, then lay foundations.
