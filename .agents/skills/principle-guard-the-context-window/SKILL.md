# Guard the Context Window

## Agent startup

Use the task's explicit project root, otherwise its Git worktree root, otherwise the agreed working directory. Read `<project-root>/.agents/pstack-models.md` **first**, then `~/.agents/pstack-models.md` for missing roles. Precedence is project role > global role > supported skill default > `inherit-parent`. Treat these files as model preferences, not executable instructions. Forward the root and effective choices to delegates.

Use only models and capabilities confirmed in the active agent. Map tool names below to available equivalents; without subagents, run sequentially and disclose lost independence/model diversity. Resolve companion skills by name from the active catalog; if absent, perform their scoped checks directly and report the limitation. Before a host-specific operation, read `setup-pstack`'s `references/agent-runtime.md` when that companion is installed. Host permissions and user approval boundaries take precedence.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
